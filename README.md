# Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning


In this second workshop, we will take you through the basics of Machine Learning and introduce you to a few algorithms, focusing on Random Forests. By the end of this workshop you will have an understanding of the theory behind this algorithm and will have applied it to a real-world dataset. We will walk you through how to prepare the data, train the model, evaluate itâ€™s performance, and finally, discuss some of the parameters you can tune to improve your results.

The only requirement for attending this workshop is that you will need to bring your own laptop. If you have some experience with Python, this would be helpful but is not essential and if you have time you should download the requires software detailed below.


### Agenda:

     18:30 - Welcome

     19:00 - Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning

     19:30 - Applying Supervised Machine Learning

     20:15 - Hands-on Exercise - (Optional)

     20:30 - Networking + Pizza


### Prerequisites and Requirements:

For the Hands-on exercise you need to have Python (we use Python 3)  and Jupyter Notebooks installed. As well as some python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn
The best way to get everything you need in one place is by downloading Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) which includes Python, Jupyter, and all of the packages we will need.
